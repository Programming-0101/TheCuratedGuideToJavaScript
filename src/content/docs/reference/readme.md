The [***MDN* Web Docs**](https://developer.mozilla.org/) should be used as the "official" reference for anything [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)/[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)/[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML). But there are *loads* of other quality resources available.

Use the reference guides here to get an overview of what I've found to be some of the best resources for learning JavaScript.
